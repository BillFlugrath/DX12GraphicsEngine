This assets folder in DXR folder is for testing code in the DXR folder.  Application specific assets should be stored
elsewhere.

Be sure to run D3D12_RAYTRACING_TIER_1_1 or higher.  Also, run the latest DXCompiler.  Currently, using 
Microsoft.Direct3D.DXC version 1.8.2505.32 downloaded via Nuget.  All DXR shaders need to be compiled at profile 6_5
or greater.

The DirectX Shader Compiler (dxcompiler.dll) and DirectX Intermediate Language validator (dxil.dll)
must be in the same directory as the executable!

The shaders used for ray tracing (in this demo) are compiled by invoking the compiler in dxcompiler.dll.
The dxcompiler.dll and dxil.dll files get loaded by code at runtime. They are in the
directory where app exe is built and put by VS. There is a Post-Build Event that performs the copy 
of the dlls into the correct location.

The paths are:
L"./bin/x64/Debug/dxcompiler.dll" and
L"./bin/x64/Release/dxcompiler.dll"

Where home dir is folder where the VS project resides.
The two dlls must be in the EXACT folder as the app.exe binary generated by VS.  If the dlls are not in the
correct folder, there will be an error when creating the rtpso with DX Errors saying that the shader code
is "unsigned" or the shaders are using "preview" or "experimental" features.
This is especially important for development builds where signing happens at runtime. 

The "Engine" code that is separate from the ray tracing DXR folder requires 
#include <D3Dcompiler.h> to properly compile.  Thus, #include <D3Dcompiler.h> is added
to the stdafx.h file.
